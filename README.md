# 📰 Fake News Detection using LSTM

This project is a **Fake News Detection Web App** built with **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **Streamlit**.  
It uses an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural network to classify news articles as *Real* or *Fake* based on their text content.

## 🧠 Model Overview

The model uses:

* Embedding layer to represent words as dense vectors

* LSTM layer to capture long-term dependencies in text

* Dense layers for classification

* Sigmoid activation for binary output (real/fake)

## 📊 Model Evaluation

Test Accuracy: 98.68%

### ✅ The model demonstrates excellent performance, effectively distinguishing between real and fake news with nearly perfect precision and recall.


## 📈 Future Improvements

* Add more advanced NLP preprocessing (lemmatization, stopwords removal)

* Use pre-trained embeddings like GloVe or BERT

* Improve UI with confidence scores and visualizations

* Deploy on Streamlit Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces
